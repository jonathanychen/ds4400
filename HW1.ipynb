There are 442 data points in total, and the target feature is the quantitative measurement of disease progression. Some plots that could be included in the EDA are scatter plots between each of the numerical attributes and the target measurement, as well as a boxplot for sex vs. target. For pre-processing, we would need to consider missing data and decide whether to remove or impute it, find the outliers and decide whether to ignore them, and scale the many numerical attributes to work with each other."
